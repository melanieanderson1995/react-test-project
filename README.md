# React Test Project

An example employee directory, completed in React.js using Material UI. Mock data is fetched from
Random User Generator (https://randomuser.me/). Some struggles with learning MatUI, mainly centering
objects.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the App

Clone the respository, cd into the cloned folder, then switch to the Master branch. Run "npm install" to install necessary dependencies.
Run "npm start" to start the development server.
